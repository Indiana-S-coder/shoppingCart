Q1. Why do you like to join as a Software developer?

=> I want to join as a software developer because I have a passion,and I'm eager to explore, to learn, to invent, to create. It's a change driving field, what seemed to be unconventional a decade ago has become the reality today. You are always learning, I am someone who gets bored of a standard routine in life and this is something that is evolving and changing. New frameworks, patterns and languages will always keep you at the tip of your toes. Its highly rewarding, with the right skill sets I will be able to make a decent living out of it.
We learn to embrace failures, negotiate for the right thing, raise flags when we need to, and learn to say no when we should. These I feel are some perils of real life that we learn automatically when in this field.
And lastly I will get to work with some sharp minds, good decision makers and great collaborators. This is an experience in itself.
