=> The 3 softwares / tools that inspire me are :

   1. VS Code
   2. Adobe illustrator
   3. MATLAB

 I have used all these softwares for upskilling as a B.E. student. VS Code is the tool I use almost everyday and I am fascinated by the multitude of programming languages and rich ecosystem of extensions it provides to make coding more enjoyable and efficient. I have used Adobe Illustrator to make logos, it awakes curiosity in me when I see my ideas visually on screen. I really want to understant how this happpens. I used MATLAB as part of curriculum as I am Electronics and Telecommunication student, I am impressed by how it solve so complex mathematics and plots various graphs. I am inspired by these tools because of the way these make things easy and seamless, without them doing things would have been hard. I cannot imagine coding without VS code.
