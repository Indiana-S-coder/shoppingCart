Q3. List top 3 organisations you like to join in your career & why you like these organisations.

=> The 3 organisations I would like to join are:
    1. Atlassian : Itâ€™s a great company with lots of smart people, good perks and fantastic offices. The company really takes care of its employees, very flexible regarding work times and location, good salary, unlimited vacation, free lunch, huge kitchen, regular events. The company itself has very flat hierarchies. Everyone can schedule a meeting with the president. The mindset is very forward thinking, modern and fast. It is known for openness and 100% remote working which I believe is good to motivate you everyday to do your job and keep work-life balance.

    2. Microsoft : Since, I use windows OS and other microsoft softwares, I want to become a part of the organisation and learn how so many things are taken care of. Apart from the perks and benefits, Microsoft is known for its amazing work culture, so I want to be a part of it.
