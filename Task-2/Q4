Q4. How you position yourself in this industry after 2 years ?

=> For a fresher like me, the next two years play a significant role. I have never stopped feeding my curiosity. For what I have heard, this industry is as good as it gets. I will contribute to my full capabilities in the upcoming years. In return, I can see myself sharpening my skills. I can feed my knowledge with the experience of the existing work team. I want to continue learning while I am performing my duty. The cycle of learning never stops. I see myself gaining knowledge in multiple fields. There is enough to learn for me. This is what I believe in. This experience can then be put to use for the progress of the organization. Having said that, the next two years can lay a solid foundation for my career. I plan to build floors of success on the foundation. This is where I see myself in the after two years.
