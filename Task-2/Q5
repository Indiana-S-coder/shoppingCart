Q5. List 3 projects / products you have built or have planned to build in the upcoming year, also explain your role in the same.

=> The 3 projects I have built or planned to build are :

    1. Sorting Visualizer: (Personal project) I made this project using Reactjs which serves two purpose. I learned react and various sorting algorithms which I was having difficulty to understand while I was starting to learn DSA.

    2. E-waste facility locator: (SIH2023 project) As an environment enthusiast, I always wanted a solution to throwing e-waste in dustbins. SIH gave this opportunity to build solution for this. This is a team project where I was reponsible in ideation and frontend development.

    3. Room finder app for college students: (planning) Being a college student I understand the difficulty in finding a good stay. I want to make this process hassle free so that students can focus on studies rather than spending time in searching for a room.
